# polydisperse_PE
grafted polyelectrolyte systems with polydispersity

LAMMPS codes: Aug-11-2017 version (see src_lmp) 
FORTRAN codes: Requires ifort compiler (see src_f90)
Python codes: Requires V3.0+ (see src_f90)
MATLAB codes: Requires 2019b+ (see src_matlab)

NOTE: For the Python codes, check the directory paths and rename accordingly. The scratch (where the codes will be running) will be DIFFERENT and needs to be changed accordingly. Specifically, one needs to set "jobdir", "scratchdir" and "lmpdir" whenever necessary. Please do a grep command to find the points where they are defined.
