How to use the MATLAB files:

Copy all output from Mesabi into the sim_results directory. See dir names for example.

***** File 1: adsfrac.m *********************************************************************

Use adsfrac.m to compute the adsorbed fraction. 
With ttestflag ON, this also writes the individual avg_f values for each case into ttest_dir (this super directory is required).
Requires output superdirectory (outfiles) and the subdirectory folders within the superdirectory.

***** File 2: basic_ttest.m ******************************************************************
Use basic_ttest.m to compute the tvalue between any two ref archs at a given pdi and n_pa value.
Requires output from adsfrac.m. 
Run adsfrac.m before running this code.

**** File 3: analyze_pdi_mw_dist.m ***********************************************************
Use this to compute the pdi and mw distribution for any given configuration.
Input requires the datafile generated by LAMMPS.
Dependencies: compute_pdi.m, compute_mwdist.m
